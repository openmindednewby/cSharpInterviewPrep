# Practice Exercises - Index

A comprehensive collection of practice exercises organized by topic to help you master C#/.NET development and prepare for senior-level technical interviews.

## How to Use This Guide

1. **Start with fundamentals** - Build a strong foundation
2. **Practice coding exercises** - Write actual code, don't just read
3. **Time yourself** - Simulate interview conditions
4. **Explain out loud** - Practice articulating your thought process
5. **Review answers** - Understand why each solution works
6. **Iterate** - Come back to difficult topics multiple times
