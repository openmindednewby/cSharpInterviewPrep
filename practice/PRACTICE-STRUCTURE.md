## Migration Notes

### Content Moved
- Root practice topic files moved into `practice/sub-notes/` for alignment with `notes/sub-notes/`.
- `advanced-topics/async-await-exercises.md` moved to `sub-notes/async-await-exercises.md`.
- `performance-memory.md` content migrated into `Memory-Allocation-Discipline/index.md`.

### Content Preserved
- `questions.md` and `answers.md` remain as all-in-one lists.
- Legacy copies retained in `sub-notes/` to avoid losing any questions.

## Next Steps

1. Create remaining SOLID principle exercise files.
2. Expand Design Patterns and Big-O exercises to target counts.
3. Build out massive-traffic topic files.
4. Add Collections detail files.

**Estimated Total Files**: 50+
**Estimated Total Exercises**: 1,000+
